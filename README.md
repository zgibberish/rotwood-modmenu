# Mod Menu

**NOTE:** This is the `playerprofile-migrate` branch, I'm updating the mod to switch from relying on PlayerProfile to store favorited mods data to other methods, since it's not supported anymore starting from REV 650126 (Ruined Capital Beta).

Mod manager UI for Rotwood, adds a "Mods" page to the game's options screen to manage/configure mods.
