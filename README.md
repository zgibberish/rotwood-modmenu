# Mod Menu

**PLEASE READ:** The current version of Mod Menu on the `main` branch is for the older modloader, and has been deprecated. If you're using the latest modloader (ModWrangler), which you probably are, please get Mod Menu from the [`modwrangler` branch](https://github.com/zgibberish/rotwood-modmenu/tree/modwrangler) instead, it's still in Beta but is stable, has more features and bug fixes.

Mod manager UI for Rotwood, adds a "Mods" page to the game's options screen to manage/configure mods.
